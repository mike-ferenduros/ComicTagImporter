ComicTagImporter
================

Scans CBZ and CBR archives for either ComicRack or ComicBookInfo (ComicBookLover) metadata, and makes it available to Spotlight for searching, smart-folders and so on.

Either Build in XCode or download from [here](https://github.com/mike-ferenduros/ComicTagImporter/releases/download/1.2/ComicTag.mdimporter.zip) and unzip, then copy the resulting ComicTag.mdimporter into either /Library/Spotlight or ~/Library/Spotlight
